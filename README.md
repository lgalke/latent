# latent

Learning **latent** representations of text and graphs.

## Features

The goal is to implement all trending deep representations for text and graphs for convenient reuse.
The methods should comply to the sklearn transformer interface, implementing the `fit` and `transform` methods.
Loading of pre-trained models should be convenient as convenient as `<class>.load("path")`.
